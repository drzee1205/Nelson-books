Sicherer Allergic or atopic patients have an altered state of reactivity to common environmental and food antigens that do not cause clinical reactions in unaffected people. Patients with clinical allergy usually produce immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies to the antigens that trigger their illness. The term allergy represents the clinical expression of IgE-­mediated allergic diseases that have a familial predisposition and that manifest as hyperresponsiveness in target organs such as the lung, skin, gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and nose. The significant increase in the prevalence of allergic diseases in the last few decades is attributed to changes in environmental factors such as exposure to tobacco smoke, air pollution, indoor and outdoor allergens, respiratory viruses, obesity, and perhaps a decline in certain infectious diseases (hygiene hypothesis).

Currently more than 1 billion patients worldwide are expected to have at least one kind of allergic disease. The hygiene hypothesis, biodiversity hypothesis and epithelial barrier hypothesis are the three main hypotheses that propose mechanisms for the development of allergic diseases. HYGIENE HYPOTHESIS The relatively recent onset of the epidemics of allergic, autoimmune, and metabolic conditions leads to the question of what might underlie their development. A prominent hypothesis is the hygiene hypothesis, which proposes that certain microorganisms or infections protect against inflammatory diseases, and that their loss, due to hygiene measures, results in an increase in allergy, asthma, and autoimmunity. Growing up on a traditional farm has a protective effect from asthma and allergies, which provides a prominent example of the hygiene hypothesis.

BIODIVERSITY HYPOTHESIS Allergic diseases are associated with a microbiome with increased colonization of opportunistic pathogens. The biodiversity hypothesis states that the observed increase in allergies is due to a loss of symbiotic relationships with bacteria and dysbiosis caused by changes in the microbiome of the gut, skin, and respiratory system. Healthy microbiota on the surface of the mucosal barrier regulates many aspects of epithelial barrier homeostasis, such as the modulation of barrier permeability and expression of epithelial barrier molecules, angiogenesis, vascular permeability, local microinflammation, and mucosal tolerance.

The protective role of parasitic infections that increase biodiversity has been questioned for the same reason. Many parasitic infections started to decrease in 1910 in New York, whereas allergies started to increase after the 1960s. Allergic asthma is still on the rise in some cities in Asia and Africa, which have low standards of hygiene.

EPITHELIAL BARRIER HYPOTHESIS The epithelial barrier hypothesis is a broader hypothesis that covers hygiene and biodiversity hypotheses and adds further insights in the pathogenesis and recent development of allergic diseases. The defective epithelial barrier concept also applies to many autoimmune and metabolic diseases showing increased prevalence during the last few decades, such as diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, liver steatosis, and obesity.

This is distinguished from general antigen responses, which induce a state of immune responsiveness without associated IgE production.

It also gives rise to the nasal crease, a horizontal skin fold over the bridge of the nose. The diagnosis of AR is based on symptoms in the absence of an upper respiratory tract infection and structural abnormalities.

This association implies that host features affecting immunologic host defense, inflammation, and the extent of airways injury from ubiquitous viral pathogens underlie susceptibility to recurrent wheezing in early childhood. Other airways exposures can also exacerbate ongoing airways inflammation, increase disease severity, and drive asthma persistence. Home allergen exposures in sensitized individuals can initiate airways inflammation and hypersensitivity to other irritant exposures and are causally linked to disease severity, exacerbations, and persistence. Consequently, eliminating the offending allergen(s) can lead to resolution of asthma symptoms.

Asthma severity is the intrinsic intensity of disease, and assessment is generally most accurate in patients not receiving controller therapy. Therefore assessing asthma severity directs the initial level of therapy.

Optimal inhalation technique for each puff of MDI-­delivered medication is a slow (5-­second) inhalation, then a 5–10-­second breath hold. No waiting time is required between puffs of medication.

Mouth rinsing is recommended after ICS use to remove ICS deposited on the oral mucosa and reduce the swallowed ICS and the risk of thrush. Nebulizers are the mainstay of aerosol treatment for infants and young children. An advantage of using nebulizers is the simple technique required of relaxed breathing. The preferential nasal breathing, small airways, low tidal volume, and high respiratory rate of infants greatly increase the difficulty of inhaled drug therapy targeting the lung airways.

Airflow obstruction during exacerbations can become extensive, resulting in life-­threatening respiratory insufficiency. Often, asthma exacerbations worsen during sleep (between midnight and 8 am), when airways inflammation and hyperresponsiveness are at their peak. Importantly, SABAs, which are first-­line therapy for asthma symptoms and exacerbations, increase pulmonary blood flow through obstructed, unoxygenated areas of the lungs with increasing dosage and frequency. When airways obstruction is not resolved with SABA use, ventilation/perfusion mismatching can cause hypoxemia, which can perpetuate bronchoconstriction and further worsen the condition. Severe, progressive asthma exacerbations need to be managed in a medical setting, with administration of supplemental oxygen as first-­line therapy and close monitoring for potential worsening.

For most patients, exacerbations improve with frequent bronchodilator treatments and a course of systemic (oral or intravenous) corticosteroid. However, the optimal management of a child with an asthma exacerbation should include a more comprehensive assessment of the events leading up to the exacerbation and the underlying disease severity. Indeed, the frequency and severity of asthma exacerbations help define the severity of a patient’s asthma. Whereas most children who experience life-­threatening asthma episodes have moderate to severe asthma by other criteria, some children with asthma appear to have mild disease except when they have severe, even near-­fatal exacerbations.

Nonatopic eczema is not associated with IgE-­mediated sensitization and is seen in 20–30% of patients with AD. Both forms of AD are associated with eosinophilia. In atopic eczema, circulating T cells expressing the skin homing receptor cutaneous lymphocyte-­associated antigen produce increased levels of T-­helper type 2 (Th2) cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-­4 and IL-­13, which induce isotype switching to IgE synthesis."}], "metadata": {"source": "Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics", "chapter": "Chapter: Allergic Disorders", "section": "There is marked perivascular T-­cell and inflammatory monocyte-­macrophage infiltration in", "category": "Allergy and Immunology", "age_group": "Pediatric", "page_number": 1875}}

Proper function of the skin depends on adequate moisture and lipid content, functional immune responses, and structural integrity. Severely dry skin is a hallmark of AD. This results from compromise of the epidermal barrier, which leads to excess transepidermal water loss, allergen penetration, and microbial colonization.

Adverse effects associated with tar preparations include skin irritation, folliculitis, and photosensitivity. Antihistamines Systemic antihistamines act primarily by blocking the histamine H1 receptors in the dermis, thereby reducing histamine-­induced pruritus. Histamine is only one of many mediators that induce pruritus of the skin, so patients may derive minimal benefit from antihistaminic therapy. Because pruritus is usually worse at night, sedating antihistamines (hydroxyzine, diphenhydramine) may offer an advantage with their soporific side effects when used at bedtime. Doxepin hydrochloride has both tricyclic antidepressant and H1-­and H2-­receptor blocking effects."}], "metadata": {"source": "Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics", "chapter": "Chapter: Allergic Disorders", "section": "From Kliegman RM, Bordini BJ, eds", "category": "Allergy and Immunology", "age_group": "Pediatric", "page_number": 636}}

For children, melatonin may be effective in promoting sleep because production is deficient in AD. Systemic Corticosteroids Systemic corticosteroids are rarely indicated in the treatment of chronic AD. The dramatic clinical improvement that may occur with systemic corticosteroids is frequently associated with a severe rebound flare of AD after therapy discontinuation. Short courses of oral corticosteroids may be appropriate for an acute exacerbation of AD while other treatment measures are being instituted in parallel.

Systemic allergic responses to insects are usually attributed to IgE antibody–mediated responses, which are caused primarily by stings from venomous insects of the order Hymenoptera and more rarely from ticks, spiders, scorpions, and Triatoma (kissing bug).

The majority of patients who experience systemic reactions after Hymenoptera stings have IgE-­mediated sensitivity to antigenic substances in the venom. Some venom allergens are homologous among members of the Hymenoptera order; others are family specific.

ETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS Urticaria is defined as the presence of wheals (hives), angioedema, or both. Acute urticaria is often caused by an allergic IgE–mediated reaction (Table 189.1). This form of urticaria is a self-­limited process that occurs when an allergen activates mast cells in the skin. Common causes of acute generalized urticaria include foods, drugs (particularly antibiotics), and stinging-­insect venoms. If an allergen (latex, animal dander) penetrates the skin locally, hives often can develop at the site of exposure. Acute urticaria can also result from non–IgE-­mediated stimulation of mast cells, caused by viral infections, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and opiates. The diagnosis of chronic urticaria is established when lesions occur on most days of the week for >6 weeks (Tables 189.2 and 189.3). In about half the cases, chronic urticaria is accompanied by angioedema. In 20% of chronic urticaria patients, angioedema occurs without wheals."}], "metadata": {"source": "Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics", "chapter": "Chapter: Allergic Disorders", "section": "The distinction is important, because the causes and mechanisms of", "category": "Allergy and Immunology", "age_group": "Pediatric", "page_number": 592}}

In contrast, urticaria associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), or other vasculitides in which a skin biopsy reveals a small-­vessel vasculitis, often have distinguishing clinical features. Lesions that burn more than itch, last >24 hours, do not blanch, blister, heal with scarring, or that are associated with bleeding into the skin (purpura) suggest urticarial vasculitis, which is a rare condition in children. Atypical aspects of the gross appearance of the hives or associated systemic symptoms should heighten concern that the urticaria or angioedema may be the manifestation of a systemic disease process (Table 189.4)."}], "metadata": {"source": "Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics", "chapter": "Chapter: Allergic Disorders", "section": "Acute angioedema without wheals is often a result of allergy,", "category": "Allergy and Immunology", "age_group": "Pediatric", "page_number": 1911}}

Once the patient cools down, the rash usually subsides in 30-­60 minutes. Occasionally, symptoms of more generalized cholinergic stimulation, such as lacrimation, wheezing, salivation, and syncope, are observed.

In some patients, attacks are preceded by the development of a rash, erythema marginatum, that is erythematous, not raised, and not pruritic. A second major symptom complex noted by patients is attacks of severe abdominal pain caused by edema of the mucosa of any portion of the GI tract. The intensity of the pain can approximate that of an acute abdomen, often resulting in unnecessary surgery, including appendectomy. Either constipation or diarrhea during these attacks can be noted.

However, rabbit-­generated ATGs, which target human T cells, continue to be widely used as immunosuppressive agents during treatment of kidney allograft recipients; serum sickness is associated with a late graft loss in kidney transplant recipients.

The immune complex is deposited in blood vessel walls and causes injury by activating the complement cascade, as seen in serum sickness. Clinical manifestations include fever, urticaria, rash, lymphadenopathy, and arthralgias. Symptoms typically appear 1-­3 weeks into the course of the offending drug and persist for days to weeks after the drug is discontinued. Delayed-­ type hypersensitivity reactions are mediated by cellular immune mechanisms. They are subdivided into four categories involving activation and recruitment of monocytes (type IVa), eosinophils (type IVb), CD4+ or CD8+ T cells (type IVc), and neutrophils (type IVd).

Because these reactions do not require prior sensitization (unlike IgE-­mediated reactions), they may occur with first exposure. The pharmacologic interaction with immune receptors concept (p-­i concept) is another type of drug hypersensitivity classification. In this scheme, a drug binds noncovalently to a T-­cell receptor, which leads to an immune response through interaction with a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) receptor.

The pathogenic mechanism has classically been thought to be non– IgE-­mediated mast cell activation (anaphylactoid). However, there is growing evidence that some immediate reactions are IgE mediated. This may be because use of older high-­osmolar RCM agents has been replaced by low-­and iso-­osmolar agents.

The cardiothoracic ratio is a less useful index of cardiac enlargement in infants than in older children because the horizontal position of the heart may increase the ratio to about 60% in the absence of true enlargement. Furthermore, the thymus may overlap not only the base of the heart but also virtually the entire mediastinum, thus obscuring the true cardiac silhouette.

These changes are reflected in the ECG over the first few weeks of life as the right ventricular (RV) wall begins to thin. The ECG demonstrates these anatomic and hemodynamic features principally by changes in QRS and T-­wave morphologic features. Typically, pediatric ECGs include several additional leads rarely used in adults, such as V3R and V4R, which are mirror images of leads V3 and V4 and are important in the evaluation of right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH). On occasion, lead V1 is inappropriately positioned too far leftward to reflect RV forces accurately. This problem is present particularly in premature infants, in whom the electrocardiographic electrode gel may produce contact among all the precordial leads. An additional lead used in children is V7, located more laterally than V6 and useful for assessing left-­sided forces.

In children with coronary artery abnormalities (e.g., Kawasaki disease or COVID-­19 with coronary aneurysms), exercise testing can detect ischemia that might otherwise be overlooked.

In younger children, exercise studies are often performed on a bicycle ergometer. Many laboratories have the capacity to measure both cardiac and pulmonary function noninvasively during exercise.

SVR is greatly decreased as the blood vessels in working muscle dilate in response to increasing metabolic demands. As the child becomes older and larger, the response of the heart rate to exercise remains prominent, but cardiac output increases because of growing cardiac volume capacity and thus SV. Responses to dynamic exercise are not dependent solely on age. For any given body surface area, boys have a larger SV than size-­matched girls. This increase is also mediated by posture.

These techniques produce tomographic images of the heart in any projection (Fig. 472.27), with excellent contrast resolution of fat, myocardium, and lung, as well as moving blood from blood vessel walls. MRI is useful in evaluating areas that are less well visualized by echocardiography, such as distal branch pulmonary artery anatomy and anomalies in systemic and pulmonary venous return. MRA allows the acquisition of images in several tomographic planes. Within each plane, images are obtained at different phases of the cardiac cycle. Thus when displayed in a dynamic “cine” format, changes in wall thickening, chamber volume, and valve function can be displayed and analyzed. Blood flow velocity and blood flow volume can be calculated.

Chapter 473 u Epidemiology and Genetic Basis of Congenital Heart Disease Section 3 Congenital Heart Disease Chapter 473 Epidemiology and Genetic Basis of Congenital Heart Disease Daniel Bernstein Congenital heart disease (CHD) occurs in approximately 0.6–1.3% of live births. The incidence is higher in stillborns (3–4%), spontaneous abortuses (10–25%), and premature infants (approximately 2%, excluding patent ductus arteriosus [PDA]). This overall incidence does not include mitral valve prolapse, PDA of preterm infants, and bicuspid aortic valve (present in 1–2% of adults)."}], "metadata": {"source": "Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics", "chapter": "Chapter: Cardiovascular Disorders", "section": "In older adults, the most common application is replacement of", "category": "Cardiology", "age_group": "Neonatal", "page_number": 1308}}

The diagnosis is established by 1 week of age in 40–50% of patients with CHD and by 1 month of age in 50–60%. Approximately 13% of infants with CHD have associated extracardiac malformations. With advances in both corrective and palliative surgery, 90% of children with CHD survive to adulthood, and in the United States, there are more adults living with CHD than there are children with CHD. Despite these advances, CHD remains the leading cause of death in children with congenital malformations. When patients with repaired or palliated CHD reach older adulthood, the risk of morbidity and mortality begins to increase (see Chapter 483.1). Table 473.1 summarizes the relative frequency of the most common congenital cardiac lesions. Most congenital defects are well tolerated in the fetus because of the parallel nature of the fetal circulation. Even the most severe cardiac defects, such as hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS), can usually be well compensated for by the fetal circulation."}], "metadata": {"source": "Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics", "chapter": "Chapter: Cardiovascular Disorders", "section": "Congenital cardiac defects have a wide spectrum of severity in", "category": "Cardiology", "age_group": "Neonatal", "page_number": 2342}}

Because the placenta provides for gas exchange and the normal fetal circulation has mixing between more highly and more poorly oxygenated blood at the foramen ovale and ductus arteriosus, fetal organ oxygen delivery is also not dramatically affected. It is only after birth, when the fetal pathways begin to close and the umbilical cord is cut, that the full hemodynamic impact of an anatomic abnormality becomes apparent. One notable exception is the case of severe regurgitant lesions, most frequently of the tricuspid valve. In these lesions, such as Ebstein anomaly of the tricuspid valve or severe right ventricular outflow obstruction (see Chapter 479.7), the parallel fetal circulation cannot compensate for the severe volume or pressure load imposed on the right side of the heart. In utero heart failure, often with fetal pleural and pericardial effusions, and generalized ascites (nonimmune hydrops fetalis) may occur."}], "metadata": {"source": "Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics", "chapter": "Chapter: Cardiovascular Disorders", "section": "In HLHS the entire fetal cardiac output is ejected by", "category": "Cardiology", "age_group": "Neonatal", "page_number": 1382}}

When pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) falls in the first several weeks of life, left-­to-­right shunting through intracardiac defects increases and 2763 symptoms and signs become more apparent. Thus in patients with a ventricular septal defect (VSD), heart failure is often first noticed between 1 and 3 months of age (see Chapter 475.6) and not in the immediate newborn period. The severity of various defects can also change dramatically with growth; some VSDs may become smaller and even close as the child ages. Alternatively, stenosis of the aortic or pulmonary valve, which may be only moderate in the newborn period, may become worse if valve orifice growth does not keep pace with patient growth (see Chapter 476.5). The physician should always be alert for associated noncardiac congenital malformations, which can adversely affect the patient’s prognosis (Tables 473.2 and 473.3)."}], "metadata": {"source": "Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics", "chapter": "Chapter: Cardiovascular Disorders", "section": "Although the most significant transitions in the circulation occur in", "category": "Cardiology", "age_group": "Neonatal", "page_number": 1245}}

Many cases of CHD are multifactorial and may result from a combination of genetic predisposition and an as-­yet-­to-­be-­determined environmental stimulus. Overall, variants in approximately 400 genes have been identified as potentially causative of CHD. Despite these advances, half of cases still lack a known genetic cause. A small percentage of congenital heart lesions are related to known chromosomal abnormalities, in particular, trisomies 21, 13, and 18 and Turner syndrome; heart disease is found in >90% of patients with trisomy 18, 50% of patients with trisomy 21, and 40% of those with Turner syndrome (see Table 473.3). Ethnic factors may have a role in CHD; certain types of VSDs (supracristal) are more common in Asian children.

These factors are dynamic and may change dramatically with age; intracardiac defects may grow smaller with time; pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), which is high in the immediate newborn period, decreases to normal adult levels by several weeks of life; and chronic exposure of the pulmonary circulation to high pressure and blood flow results in a gradual increase in PVR (Eisenmenger physiology; see Chapter 482.2).

With large defects, the ratio of pulmonary-­to-­ systemic blood flow (Qp:Qs) is usually between 2:1 and 4:1.

A significant number (30–50%) of small defects close spontaneously, most frequently during the first 2 years of life. Small muscular VSDs are more likely to close (up to 80%) than membranous VSDs (up to 35%). Most defects that close do so before age 4 years, although spontaneous closure has been reported in adults. VSDs that close often have ventricular septal aneurysm (accessory tricuspid valve) tissue covering them that limits the magnitude of the shunt. Most children with small restrictive defects remain asymptomatic, without evidence of an increase in heart size, PAP, or PVR; a long-­term risk is infective endocarditis.

A radial-­femoral delay occurs when blood flow to the descending aorta is dependent on collaterals, in which case the femoral pulse is felt after the radial pulse. In normal persons (except neonates), systolic BP in the legs obtained by the cuff method is usually 10-­20 mm Hg higher than that in the arms.

This test is based on the premise that neonates with cyanotic CHD usually are unable to significantly raise their arterial blood partial pressure of oxygen (Pao2) during administration of 100% oxygen, whereas in infants with pulmonary disease, high levels of intraalveolar Po2 will overcome at least some of the ventilation-­perfusion abnormalities and reverse the hypoxia. This test is performed using a hood rather than nasal cannula or face mask to guarantee delivery of almost 100% oxygen to the patient. False-­positive tests can occur if this is not done correctly.

In infants with cyanosis from a central nervous system disorder, the Pao2 usually normalizes completely during artificial ventilation. If A B 2799 the Pao2 is between 100 and 150 mmHg, then cyanotic congenital heart lesions, increased pulmonary blood flow (mixing lesions, see Chapter 480), or PPHN are more likely. If the Pao2 is less than 100 mm Hg, then CHD with decreased pulmonary blood flow (see Chapter 479) is more likely. Another clue to etiology is that hypoxia in many heart lesions is relatively constant, whereas in respiratory disorders and in PPHN, Pao2 often varies with time or changes in ventilator management. For example, hyperventilation may improve the hypoxia in neonates with PPHN but only occasionally in those with cyanotic CHD.

The consequences of this deviation are the four components that Fallot initially described: (1) obstruction to right ventricular (RV) outflow (pulmonary stenosis); (2) a malalignment type of ventricular septal defect (VSD); (3) dextroposition of the aorta so that it overrides the ventricular septum; and (4) right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH; Fig. Obstruction to 80 60 2 3 100 2 60 3 2 1 95 60 Fig. 479.1 Physiology of tetralogy of Fallot.

The valve itself is often bicuspid or unicuspid and, occasionally, is the only site of stenosis. More often, the subpulmonic or infundibular muscle, known as the crista supraventricularis, is hypertrophic, which contributes to the subvalvar stenosis and results in an infundibular chamber of variable size and contour.

In these extreme cases, pulmonary blood flow may be supplied by a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) or by multiple major aortopulmonary collateral arteries (MAPCAs) arising from the ascending and/or descending aorta or aortic branches and supplying various lung segments. The VSD is usually nonrestrictive and large, is located just below the aortic valve, and is related to the posterior and right aortic cusps. Rarely, the VSD may be in the inlet portion of the ventricular septum (tetralogy with atrioventricular septal defect). The normal fibrous continuity of the mitral and aortic valves is usually maintained, and if not (because of the presence of a subaortic muscular conus), the defect is classified as a double-­outlet right ventricle (DORV) instead of tetralogy of Fallot (see Chapter 479.5)."}], "metadata": {"source": "Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics", "chapter": "Chapter: Cardiovascular Disorders", "section": "An MPA segment may be in continuity with RV outflow,", "category": "Cardiology", "age_group": "Pediatric", "page_number": 348}}

Systemic venous return to the right atrium and right ventricle is normal. When the right ventricle contracts in the presence of marked pulmonary stenosis, blood is shunted into the overriding aorta or across the VSD into the aorta. Persistent arterial desaturation and cyanosis result, with the degree of desaturation dependent on the severity of the pulmonary obstruction. Pulmonary blood flow, when severely restricted by the obstruction to RV outflow, is often supplemented by a PDA during the immediate newborn period.
